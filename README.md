# [Project 1: Detecting Parkinson's Disease Tremors](https://github.com/kingy434/MScProject)

This project was undertaken as my final MSc project. The aim was to be able to build a model that could accurately predict Parkinson's Disease tremors based on sensor readings. This process was done in two phases: the training phase carried out on data labelled with causal factors such as medication intake or patient ID with cross validation performed to see how accurate the models are, and the testing phase carried out on unlabelled data to see whether the trained models made any clinical sense. Below is the final testing results using a Random Forest classifier and a Logistic Regression classifier.

# [Project 2: The Chase: Israel](https://github.com/kingy434/Sam-portfolio/tree/main/thechase)

As an avid gameshow watcher, particularly The Chase on ITV I sought out to find a dataset related to the gameshow. I was able to find a dataset regarding the contestants on the Israeli version of the show I performed extensive data analysis and was able to make some interesting graphs regarding the behaviour of the players.

# [Project 3: Epitope and amino acid analysis](https://github.com/kingy434/Sam-portfolio/tree/main/epitope)

My first full project I completed in R for my Master's degree module. Looked at trends within amino acid sequences of epitope strengths Extensive data analysis performed expanding the data set to make new features. Built a classification model with only 60% accuracy, although due to the size of the dataset a more powerful computer would have allowed me to achieve greater accuracy by tuning the parameters.

# [Project 4: Spotify song recommendation based on song features](https://github.com/kingy434/Sam-portfolio/tree/main/spotify-project)

This is a project I did in Python where I tried to make song recommendations based on the properties of songs someone liked. I had a dataset of roughly 170k spotify songs with all the features listed with no missing data. I treated this as a clustering problem, and made recommendations based on these clusters. The recommendations were somewhat close in some areas of my deployment but others not so much, it was difficult to separate into many clusters. I presented my findings into a neat pdf report.
