This is a project I did in Python where I tried to make song recommendations based on the properties of songs someone liked. 
I had a dataset of roughly 170k spotify songs with all the features listed with no missing data
I treated this as a clustering problem, and made recommendations based on these clusters
The recommendations were somewhat close in some areas of my deployment but others not so much, it was difficult to separate into many clusters.
I presented my findings into a neat pdf report.
