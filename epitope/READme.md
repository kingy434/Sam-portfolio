My first full project I completed in R for my Master's degree module. Looked at trends within amino acid sequences of epitope strengths
Extensive data analysis performed expanding the data set to make new features.
Built a classification model with only 60% accuracy, although due to the size of the dataset a more powerful computer would have allowed me to achieve greater accuracy
by tuning the parameters.
